## Installation

This directory contains java plugins, jython scripts, and macros (in the [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) macro language).

These are designed to work with [Fiji](http://fiji.sc). Plain ImageJ does not support Jython.

To install, follow instructions [here](http://fiji.sc/Installing_3rd_party_plugins "Fiji Installing Plugins").
