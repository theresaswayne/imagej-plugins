Custom plugins and macros for ImageJ and Fiji

## Installation

These are java plugins, jython scripts, and macros (in the [ImageJ](http://imagej.nih.gov/ij/) macro language) here.

These are designed to work with [Fiji](http://fiji.sc). Plain ImageJ does not support Jython.

To install, follow instructions [here](http://fiji.sc/Installing_3rd_party_plugins "Fiji Installing Plugins").

## Disclaimer

I have tested these at the time of uploading, but they may not be actively kept up to date with future versions of ImageJ/Fiji. If you find a bug, please contact me.
