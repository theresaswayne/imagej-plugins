## Installation

### For jython scripts (.py): 

Use the [Fiji](http://imagej.net/Fiji) distribution of ImageJ. Plain ImageJ does not support Jython.

To run the script from anywhere on your computer, open Fiji, `File > Open`, select the script, and click `Run`.

To install so that the command appears in the ImageJ menu, follow instructions [here](http://imagej.net/Installing_3rd_party_plugins).

### For ImageJ1 macros (.ijm):

Use Fiji or plain ImageJ.

To run the macro from anywhere on your computer, open Fiji, `File > Open`, select the script, and click `Run`.

To install so that the command appears in the ImageJ menu, follow instructions [here](http://imagej.net/Installing_3rd_party_plugins).

### For Batch commands (.txt):

Use Fiji or plain ImageJ.

1. Open the Batch Macro command (`Process > Macro...`). 
2. Set the `Input` folder to the folder containing the images you want to process. All files in the folder will be processed. 
1. Set the `Output` folder to a *different* folder where the results will be saved. 
1. Click `Open` and select the .txt file.
1. Click Process.

## Disclaimer

I have tested these at the time of uploading, but they may not be actively kept up to date with future versions of ImageJ. If you find a bug, please contact me.
